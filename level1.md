## Chapter 1

I see a big snake in a book. The snake eats an animal.

After eating an animal, this snake **does not need to** eat for six months.

I draw that big snake. **This is drawing number one.**

But the man says, "This is a drawing of a hat."

My drawing is not of a hat. So, I draw an elephant inside the snake. This is drawing number two.

The man says to me, "Stop painting. Just do other things." So, I give up **being a painter**.

Now I am a pilot. I can fly to many **cities in the world.**

I meet many great people. But, **my mind does not change.**

When I meet a smart person, I show them drawing number one.

The person says. "That is a hat."

So, I never talk to that person about big snakes or the jungle. I talk about card games and golf **to make him happy.**


## Chapter 2

I have only one friend, and he is the little prince.

My plane doesn't work in the desert. And I am alone. Also, I only have water for a week

**On the first night,** I go to sleep **on the sand.** I hear a strange little voice **in the morning.**

"Draw me a sheep."

"What?"

**There is a child who looks at me carefully.** Here is a drawing of him. But, he looks sweeter than my drawing. That is because, as you know, I do not draw anymore.

I look at the child with surprise. You know that is the desert. The child **doesn't seem** lost in the desert.

I say, "What are you doing here?"

And he repeats, "Draw me a sheep."

So I take out a sheet of paper and a pen. I am still in the desert.

As you know, I do not know how to draw. But, he says to me:

"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."

I do not draw a sheep. I draw the boa snake.

Then he says, "No, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa snake. I need a sheep. Draw me a sheep."

So I draw a sheep.

But he says to me, "No this sheep is already very sickly."

So, I draw another one once more.

But, he says to me, "No."

I draw another one **in a hurry.**

"This is a box. The sheep is inside the box."

He speaks with a bright face.

"That is exactly what I want. Does this sheep eat a lot?"

"Why?"

"In my place, everything is small."

I say, "He is a very small sheep. There is enough grass for him."

He says, "Not so small. Look! He is sleeping."


## Chapter 3

**I get to know** the little prince little by little.

When he sees my airplane, he asks me, "What is that?"

"That is an airplane. It can fly."

He cries out, "What! You drop down from the sky?"

I answer softly, "Yes."

"Oh! That is funny! Ha ha!"

"So, you come from the sky too!"

"Where is your star?"

I ask him quickly with surprise.

"Do you come from another star?" But he does not answer.

He looks at the plane and says. "You cannot come from very far away."

After a time, he carefully takes the drawing of the sheep out of his pocket.

I ask many questions, "Where do you come from? Where do you want to take your sheep?"

He says, "This box is the sheep's house at night."

"If you are good, I can give you a rope to tie the sheep."

"Tie the sheep? That is strange."

"But if you don't tie the sheep, he goes away."

"It is okay because my star is so small."

## Chapter 4

I have more information about the little prince. His star is about the size of a house.

When a star scientist finds a small star, he gives it a name by number. I belive the little prince came from star B-612.

A Turkish star scientist finds this star, but nobody believes his words because he is wearing Turkish clothes.

A Turkish leader has great power. He orders his people to change from Turkish clothes to European clothes. The star scientist wears European clothes and talks about the B-612 again. Everybody belives his words.

I talk about numbers a lot because men like numbers. When you tell them that you have a new friend, they ask you these questions: "How old he is?" "How many brothers does he have?"

They always want to know numbers.

If you talk to men, you have to tell them, "I see a house that cost 20,000 dollars."

Then they say, "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"

If you say to them, "There is the little prince. He is lovely, and he is looking for a sheep."

They consider you to be like a child.

But if you say to them, "The star he cames from is B-612." They can understand what you say.

I like to begin this story like a fairy tale, but people may read it lightly and forget about it.

My friend is not with me. I don't want to forget the little prince, so I'm describing him here. This is why I buy a box of paints and pencils. But, It's not easy for me to draw again at my age.

Sometimes, I make some errors, but I try to draw as best as I can. Imake mistakes on important details, but that is not my fault. My friend never explains anything to me.
