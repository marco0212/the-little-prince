## Chapter 1

I see a big snake in a book. The snake eats an animal.

After eating an animal, this snake **does not need to** eat for six months.

I draw that big snake. **This is drawing number one.**

But the man says, "This is a drawing of a hat."

My drawing is not of a hat. So, I draw an elephant inside the snake. This is drawing number two.

The man says to me, "Stop painting. Just do other things." So, I give up **being a painter**.

Now I am a pilot. I can fly to many **cities in the world.**

I meet many great people. But, **my mind does not change.**

When I meet a smart person, I show them drawing number one.

The person says. "That is a hat."

So, I never talk to that person about big snakes or the jungle. I talk about card games and golf **to make him happy.**
